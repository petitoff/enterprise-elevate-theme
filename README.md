# Hugo Enterprise Elevate

Up Business is a clean and modern landing page, inspired on light illustrations
with a modern look, that can be used for companies or to showcase a product.

## Quick Start

The folder `hugoBasicExample` contains a working version of a website with the
theme. It includes: the configuration file `config.yaml`, the content folder
`content` and the `data` folder. It's a good idea to copy this over to the
project folder to get an initial version of the website up and running.

Now `hugo server` will start the local development server with a working
version of the website with the theme.
